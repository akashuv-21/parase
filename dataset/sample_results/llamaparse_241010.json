Degree completion is uneven across race and income factors (among others), making academia not demographically representative of our society as a whole. Some perspectives are therefore systematically underrepresented in groups with advanced degrees.\n\n- Peer Review: Peer review sometimes only results in collaborative improvements to a work. It can also prevent the publication of very obviously flawed or poorly executed or analyzed research. Very new or radical ideas may be initially rejected because they are such a departure from existing dogma. Peer review is largely a practice of academia, therefore has the same exclusionary problems mentioned in the credentials section. It is possible for individual reviewers to act in a biased or unethical way to prevent the publication of some works.\n\n- Fact Checking: Not a lot of downside here.

During the extreme phases, this assumption is no longer reasonable. Again the model will be extremely simplified, but still it is based on physical intuition and, most importantly, completely time symmetric. Assume that the only types of edges having a non-neglectable chance of occurring during the extreme phase [-m - 1, -m] are of the following two kinds: The first scenario is that the universe passes through the extreme phase into a state of zero entropy. The other scenario is that it passes into a state with high entropy (equal to 2m). Universes of one of these two types will be given the (un-normalized) probability 1 or p, respectively. Here p > 0 should be thought of as a very small number, at least when the size of the model becomes large. During the other extreme phase [m, m + 1], near the Big Crunch, we make the completely symmetric assumption.\n\nRemark 3. These assumptions may perhaps seem somewhat arbitrary. And to a certain extent, this may be so. However, they do represent the following viewpoint of what may happen at the full cosmological scale: we may think of the Big Bang and the Big Crunch as states of complete order with zero volume and entropy. Such states can very well be metastable, very much like an oversaturated gas at a temperature below the point of condensation. If no disturbance takes place, such metastable states can very well continue to exist for a substantial period of time. In particular, a low-entropy state can have a very good chance of surviving the intense but extremely short extreme phase. On the other hand, if a sufficiently large disturbance occurs, then the metastable state may almost immediately decay into a very disordered state of high entropy.\n\nIt is not my intension to further argue in favor of this viewpoint here. The main thing in this chapter is to show that completely symmetric boundary conditions at the endpoints may give rise to a broken time symmetry.\n\nThe multiverse now splits up into four different kinds of paths:\n\n- LL: The entropy is low (=0) at both ends (-m and m).\n- LH: The entropy is 0 at -m and 2m at m.\n- HL: The entropy is 2m at -m and 0 at m.\n- HH: The entropy is high (= 2m) at both ends (-m and m).\n\nIf we now denote by N_LL, N_LH, N_HL and N_HH the number of paths of the indicated kinds, then with the above assumptions we also get the corresponding probability weights for the corresponding types as\n\nP_LL = N_LL,   P_LH = pN_LH,   P_HL = pN_HL,   P_HH = p^2N_HH.   (10)\n\nWe can now consider the following two types of broken time symmetry:\n\nDefinition 4. A multiverse is said to exhibit a weak broken time symmetry if\n\nP_LL \u226a P_LH + P_HL.   (11)\n\nDefinition 5. A multiverse is said to exhibit a strong broken time symmetry if\n\nP_LL + P_HH \u226a P_LH + P_HL.

However, each trial takes longer than in those single-presentation tasks, which makes experiments more onerous. There are a few reasons why the roving-standard 2xSJ is still worth considering. Firstly, it asks about synchrony explicitly (unlike the TOJ) and by requiring relative judgements it reveals a point of maximal synchrony perception (whereas the SJ and ternary tasks often reveal a range of SOA values that are classified as synchronous). Secondly, it can be added in to a single-presentation task (as a follow-up question every two trials), which somewhat mitigates the burden of additional experimental time. Finally, a case can be made that it will be more resistant to some forms of decision-level bias (Morgan, Grant, Melmoth, & Solomon, 2015; Morgan, Melmoth, & Solomon, 2013).

Phenolphthalein changes from colorless to faint pink when the quantity of OH\u207b ions added via the NaOH equals the quantity of H\u207a ions in the solution (that is, when the pH is raised to 7). For this activity, assume the soil samples have been extracted and the filtrates are now available for analysis.\n\n1. Place 10 ml of each filtrate into separate 125 ml flasks. This 10 ml quantity is the amount of filtrate from 1.0 gram of soil.\n2. Add 10 drops of the phenolphthalein indicator.\n3. Titrate the extract with the NaOH solution to a faint pink endpoint. The titration must be done very carefully to obtain meaningful results. If you put too much NaOH in the flask and get a bright pink color, discard the solution and repeat the process. In the table below, record the milliliters of NaOH solution used to achieve the endpoint.\n\nCalculate the CEC and record your data in Table 13.3.\n\nHere is an example of how to calculate the CEC, assuming 2.5 mL of NaOH was required to achieve an end point.

Historians argue that Spain's strong Catholic traditions ushered in patriarchal norms and practices that were not present in the pre-Hispanic period. National hero, Jose Rizal, has documented this in his \"Letter to the Women of Malolos,\" praising the women for advocating their right to education. Historians also found proof of women's contribution to the Philippine revolution (Camagay 1998). Decades later, the suffragist movement ushered in one of the first national issues to have brought Filipino women together. It was a hard-fought battle; the movement had to contend with staunch opposition from antisuffragists in the Constitutional Convention that drafted the 1935 Constitution. The reluctance was expected because only 21-year-old Filipino men had been allowed to vote during the time. They framed their opposition based on traditional notions of womanhood and their role in the private sphere, foremost of which is motherhood. Another key argument against female suffrage was the idea that politics is supposed to be \"dirty\" and that this would taint families if women took part in politics. The assumptions catered to the age-old public-private divide, strongly suggesting that only men are qualified to occupy the former.\n\nEventually, the 1935 Constitution granted women suffrage on the condition that more than 300,000 women would vote affirmatively in a plebiscite. When signing the law paving the way for the said plebiscite, President Manuel Quezon had this to say to Filipino men: \"Are you going to deprive our women of the opportunity to say how their lives are going to be regulated and is it fair for us to presume that men can always speak in this country for women?\" (Official Gazette 1936). In April 1937, more than 400,000 women voted in favor of their right to vote and participate in political life. In 1946 and 1947, Filipinos elected the first woman member of the House of Representatives, and senator, respectively. Nonetheless, data from 1946 to 1992 indicate an uphill climb. For instance, in the 1949 and 1953 elections for the House of Representatives, only one woman was elected out of the 100 positions.", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000184.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 70, "y": 51}, {"x": 221.319981376, "y": 51}, {"x": 221.319981376, "y": 63.999998399999996}, {"x": 70, "y": 63.999998399999996}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "Semantic Search Pack: Value", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 70, "y": 87}, {"x": 385.22843696735544, "y": 87}, {"x": 385.22843696735544, "y": 108.9999984}, {"x": 70, "y": 108.9999984}], "category": "heading1", "id": 1, "content": {"text": "SS Pack allows businesses to access further data more rapidly", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 48, "y": 177}, {"x": 673.3579971375999, "y": 177}, {"x": 673.3579971375999, "y": 187.9999992}, {"x": 48, "y": 187.9999992}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 2, "content": {"text": "The SS Pack can reduce the information acquisition time by returning all the information that matches the user's search intent.\n\nThe performance optimized for individual search systems is maintained by automatic updates of real-time search log records, augmented by Upstage's technological know-how.", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}], "category": "table", "id": 3, "content": {"text": "", "html": "<table><thead><tr><th>1.8X \u2191\u00b9</th><th>Optimal Attempt</th><th>SOTA\u00b2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Higher Return of Information</td><td>Reduced Information Acquisition Time</td><td>Cutting-Edge Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Unlike existing search systems that only return information limited to the entered search keywords, SS Pack returns all relevant data that meet the user's search intent</td><td>By returning all semantic-based information of the search keywords, the time required for information acquisition is reduced drastically compared to that of traditional keyword-matching search systems</td><td>The analysis of user logs saved in real-time allows us to further optimize the individual search services over time</td></tr></tbody></table>", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 51.120000000000005, "y": 281}, {"x": 718.563, "y": 281}, {"x": 718.563, "y": 295.08}, {"x": 51.120000000000005, "y": 295.08}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 4, "content": {"text": "1.

This spreadsheet is linked to the students' randomly assigned course ID (CID) numbers. The other spreadsheet, which is linked to their university student ID numbers and their names, compiles their performances on quizzes, homework, and exams assigned throughout the semester.\n\nAt the risk of sounding draconian, this is a course where it may make sense to base upwards of 50% of a student's grade upon their in-person attendance, which would entail carefully taking role at the beginning of each class. If the class meets 30 times face-to-face during the semester, for example, their grade attributable to attendance would then drop by 3.33 percentage points for each missed class (excused absences withstanding). Granted, students who foresee having difficulty attending class in-person throughout the semester would likely choose to drop the course immediately. For those students who remain, the remaining 50% of their course grade would then be based upon their quizzes, homework, and exam scores.\n\nThe issue of how best to convey written information to the student a priori (i.e., before conducting a given experiment or game) also looms large in a participatory-learning setting such as this, especially if the instructor desires to obtain unbiased responses from the students (or more practically, to control for potential biases). For example, the first set of thought experiments presented in Section 1 is meant to demonstrate firsthand to the students the extent to which automatic, knee-jerk responses from what Kahneman (2011) identifies as the System 1 portion of the brain can result in miscalculations. Students who choose to read ahead (small in number though these types of students may be) potentially skew the distribution of responses away from its otherwise true representation of these miscalculations. Such skewness may be tolerable for strictly educational purposes, where the goal is to demonstrate that at least a certain percentage of students are prone to miscalculation. But if the instructor also hopes to compile student responses into a dataset amenable for statistical analysis, then this type of potential bias draws into question the validity of the data.^2\n\nTo help control for potential biases associated with students having read ahead about the game or experiment they are now participating in, I recommend including the following question on each Response Card: \"Did you read about this topic ahead of time?\" (see Appendix A). Answers to this question provide a control for the level of student foreknowledge, which is the potential bias of concern.\n\nI am personally unaware of any studies that have looked at how well students learn the lessons of behavioral economics in a cumulative sense over a span of time (e.g., an entire semester) and across a variety of experiments and games. In other words, I know of no studies that estimate the extent to which individuals who begin a course in behavioral economics as bona fide Homo sapiens evolve toward \"Homo economism\" in their individual and social choices. The pedagogy promoted in this textbook\u2014in particular, the data it generates\u2014offers instructors the opportunity to empirically test the hypothesis that students make this evolution.\n\n2. Note that this potential biasedness problem also extends to the laboratory experiments of Section 2 and games of Section 3.\n\nBEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS PRACTICUM XXV", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000013.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 56, "y": 43.00800000000004}, {"x": 266.102, "y": 43.00800000000004}, {"x": 266.102, "y": 54.00800000000004}, {"x": 56, "y": 54.00800000000004}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "150                                                                                              AL-OGAYYEL AND OSKAY\n\nA set of images showing al-Sadu weaving tools and techniques\n\nFigure 8.8    Symbol of stars in contemporary al-Sadu\n              weaving by Leila Yaser.\n\nobjects\u2014such as kilims, clothes, bags, blankets,\nand tablecloths\u2014were in other parts of the\nworld.

They covered Lower Silesia in 1938 in remarkable detail, although such detail also helped obscure the printed names of villages, which were lost in the depictions of miniature hills, rivers, quarries, castles, lakes and even houses.\n\nEventually I did locate the village through this superb map. Steinkirche was off the main road near the second railway station south of Strehlen, probably on a hill, something my mother had never mentioned. If one passed it, one could also locate it as station number two of the seven between Strehlen and M\u00fcnsterberg, on the railway running south of Breslau towards the Carpathian Mountains. Then I noted the Polish names for the two townships south of Wroclaw (Breslau). In the German-to-Polish Gazeteer they are given as Strzelin and Ziebice.\n\nMy intention was to take a train or a car to the new Polish ex-Steinkirche, visit it discreetly, and search the old cemetery for family connections. I wanted to photograph my two-year-old granddaughter beside my own grandfather Friedrich's grave. I wanted to look for other evidence of family history, and just savour the atmosphere of the place. I also wanted to see what had happened to Neumarkt Platz.\n\nIt was difficult to achieve anything in a hurry. In London, my daughter, granddaughter and I visited the office of the Polish Consulate. Tourist brochures were generously given to us, but none of the authoritative road maps of Poland showed the villages between Strzelin and Ziebice. Did our village still exist? And by what name?\n\nAfter flying to Berlin, we set out in a hire car for Wroclaw on 13 September 2003. Beside the Hitler-era Autobahn, there are still extensive forests, between flat farmlands. It was raining when we entered Poland.\n\n9", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000186.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 70, "y": 110.17711187250998}, {"x": 524.3741409620002, "y": 110.17711187250998}, {"x": 524.3741409620002, "y": 122.13231187250999}, {"x": 70, "y": 122.13231187250999}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph \"Step 1-1\"\n        A[32 Layers] --> |Copy| B[32 Layers]\n    end\n    subgraph \"Step 1-2\"\n        C[8 Layers] --> |Merge| D[24 Layers]\n        E[8 Layers] --> |Merge| D\n    end\n    subgraph \"Step 1: Depthwise Scaling\"\n        A --> C\n        B --> E\n    end\n    subgraph \"Step 2: Continued Pretraining\"\n        F[24 Layers] --> |Continued Pretraining| G[48 Layers]\n        H[24 Layers] --> |Continued Pretraining| G\n    end\n    D --> F\n    D --> H\n```\n\nFigure 1: Depth up-scaling for the case with n = 32, s = 48, and m = 8.

We consider that the particular way of depthwise scaling has isolated the heterogeneity in the scaled model which allowed for this fast performance recovery.\n\nDelving deeper into the heterogeneity of the scaled model, a simpler alternative to depthwise scaling could be to just repeat its layers once more, i.e., from n to 2n layers. Then, the 'layer distance', or the difference in the layer indices in the base model, is only bigger than 1 where layers n and n + 1 are connected, i.e., at the seam.\n\nHowever, this results in maximum layer distance at the seam, which may be too significant of a discrepancy for continued pretraining to quickly resolve.

Lavish dresses and embellishments become insignia of wealth, power, and nonconformity, of a way of life outside the economic constraints of the Western civilization. Interestingly, such projections were internalized by eighteenth-century British subjects in the fashionable \"Turquerie\" that allowed the wearers to display their wealth by wearing Oriental dress, turbans, ostrich plumes, long capes, veils, and flattering shalvars (figs. 4.9 and 4.10). Another infusion of Orientalism in the West, the tradition of painting European figures in Middle Eastern dress, becomes a form of cultural cross-dressing meant to suggest misuse of power or excessive wealth (fig. 4.11). Such cultural imports are difficult to be understood, to use Said's qualification, as expressions of the Occident's cultural \"antipathy\"^84 toward the Orient; rather, they reflect the West's attraction to a space that connotes difference understood as extraordinariness rather than inferiority.\n\nBesides their connotations of magic, exoticism, and wealth, the things in the Arabian Nights are also rich bearers of cultural information: as Marina Warner correctly pointed out, \"stories are lodged in goods\"^85 and as such, they expand the reader's\n\n84 Said, Orientalism, 260.\n85 Marina Warner, introduction to Stranger Magic: Charmed States and the Arabian Nights (London: Chatto & Windus, 2011), 8.", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000009.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 56, "y": 43.00800000000004}, {"x": 266.3428999999999, "y": 43.00800000000004}, {"x": 266.3428999999999, "y": 54.00800000000004}, {"x": 56, "y": 54.00800000000004}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "74                                                                                                                                   BAIRD\n\n[A mezzotint image titled \"The HONEY-MOON\" is displayed.

We had to introduce extraneous symbols (q and q\u0307) in order to indicate the argument position specifying the partial derivative. Nothing would change here if we replaced q and q\u0307 by a and b\u00b3. We can simplify the notation by admitting that the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian are themselves new functions, and by specifying the particular partial derivative by the position of the argument that is varied\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}((\\partial_2L)(t, w(t), \\frac{d}{dt}w(t))) - (\\partial_1L)(t, w(t), \\frac{d}{dt}w(t)) = 0,$$\n\nwhere \u2202\u1d62L is the function which is the partial derivative of the function L with respect to the ith argument.\u2074\n\nTwo different notions of derivative appear in this expression.

It applies to an expression that involves the variable t and it gives the rate of change of the value of the expression as the value of the variable t is varied.\n\nThese are both useful interpretations of the idea of a derivative. But functions give us more power. There are many equivalent ways to write expressions that compute the same value. For example 1/(1/r\u2081 + 1/r\u2082) = (r\u2081r\u2082)/(r\u2081 + r\u2082). These expressions compute the same function of the two variables r\u2081 and r\u2082. The first expression fails if r\u2081 = 0 but the second one gives the right value of the function.

In particular, when an individual (say, Player 1) acquires private information about something of common interest to both himself and another individual (say, Player 2), and Player 2 knows Player 1 has acquired this private information, Player 1 could actually be made worse off as a result of Player 2 changing her strategy in response to the fact that she knows Player 1 now has additional information.

In contrast (and, as we will see, with no small touch of irony) Homo sapiens is Latin for \"wise man.\" For a deep dive into evolution of Homo sapiens, particularly from the start of the Cognitive Revolution 70,000 years ago, see Harari (2015).\n\n2.

(2012) asked participants in an online survey to imagine themselves as one of four households facing a water shortage due to a drought affecting their shared well. The survey assigned the label \"consumers\" to half of the participants and \"individuals\" to the other half. Those imagining themselves as consumers reported feeling less personal responsibility to reduce their water demand, and less trust in others to do the same, than did those referred to as individuals.

In the instruction tuning stage, the model is trained to follow instructions in a QA format (Zhang et al., 2023). We mostly use open-source datasets but also synthesize a math QA dataset to enhance the model's mathematical capabilities. A rundown of how we crafted the dataset is as follows. First, seed math data are collected from the Math (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset only, to avoid contamination with commonly used benchmark datasets such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Then, using a process similar to MetaMath (Yu et al., 2023), we rephrase the questions and answers of the seed math data. We use the resulting rephrased question-answer pairs as a QA dataset and call it 'Synth. Math-Instruct'.\n\nAlignment tuning. In the alignment tuning stage, the instruction-tuned model is further fine-tuned to be more aligned with human or strong AI (e.g., GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023)) preferences using sDPO (Kim et al., 2024a), an improved version of direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). Similar to the instruction tuning stage, we use mostly open-source datasets but also synthesize a math-focused alignment dataset utilizing the 'Synth. Math-Instruct' dataset mentioned in the instruction tuning stage.\n\nThe alignment data synthesis process is as follows. We take advantage of the fact that the rephrased question-answer pairs in Synth. Math-Instruct data are beneficial in enhancing the model's mathematical capabilities (see Sec. 4.3.1). Thus, we speculate that the rephrased answer to the rephrased question is a better answer than the original answer, possibly due to the interim rephrasing step. Consequently, we set the rephrased question as the prompt and use the rephrased answer as the chosen response and the original answer as the rejected response and create the {prompt, chosen, rejected} DPO tuple. We aggregate the tuples from the rephrased question-answer pairs and call the resulting dataset 'Synth.

The 2011 Great East Japan earthquake generated a large tsunami that caused an unprecedented biological transoceanic rafting event from the northwestern Pacific coastline of Japan towards North America on the eastern Pacific(Carlton et al. 2017). Millions of human made objects from small plastics to large docks and whole ships were cast adrift in the Pacific (Murray et al. 2018). This provided a substrate for biofoulers.

The progression often follows these stages:\n\n- Stage 1: I just want to catch a fish!\n- Stage 2: I want to catch a lot of fish!\n- Stage 3: I want to catch big fish.\n- Stage 4: I'm just happy to be out fishing.\n- Stage 5: I want to pass on my knowledge and passion for fishing.\n\nStudies of angler characteristics confirm that there is no such thing as an \"average\" angler. Rather, anglers are a heterogeneous and changing group. Therefore, we can segment anglers in distinct categories for analysis (Bryan 1977; Kyle et al. 2007; Beardmore et al. 2013; TenHarmsel et al. 2019).

We use 'Cand. 1' and 'Cand. 2' from Tab. 6 as our two models for merging. We name the merged models with the 'Merge' prefix to indicate they are merged. The best scores for H6 and the individual tasks are shown in bold.\n\nscores for tasks like ARC, HellaSwag, and Truth-fulQA all improved by good margins, the score for GSM8K is 58.83, which is lower than the SFT base model score of 64.14. Adding Synth. Math-Alignment to train 'DPO v2', we see that the GSM8k score improves to 60.27, which is lower than the SFT base model but still higher than 'DPO v1'. Other task scores are also not negatively impacted by adding Synth. Math-Alignment. Thus, we can conclude that adding Synth. Math-Alignment is beneficial for H6.\n\nThen, we experiment whether merging 'DPO v1' and 'DPO v2' is beneficial. Unfortunately, 'DPO v1+v2' scores 73.21 in H6, which is worse than 'DPO v2'. More importantly, the gain in the GSM8K score from adding Synth. Math-Alignment is gone, which is undesirable. One reason for this could be that 'DPO v2' is a strict improvement over 'DPO v1', unlike the case for merging 'SFT v3' and 'SFT v4' where the models had different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAblation on the SFT base models. When applying DPO, we start from a model that is already instruction tuned ,i.e., the SFT base model and ablate on using different SFT base models. We use Ultrafeedback Clean and Synth. Math-Alignment datasets for this ablation. Each of the ablated models is trained as follows. 'DPO v2' uses 'SFT v3' as the base SFT model, while 'DPO v3' uses 'SFT v3+v4' as the SFT base model instead.\n\nNote that 'SFT v3+v4' has higher scores on all tasks compared to 'SFT v3', and the gap is especially large for ARC (+1.45) and GSM8K (+2.43). Surprisingly, the two models perform similarly in terms of H6. A closer look at the scores for the individual tasks shows only a small margin in the GSM8K scores, and other task scores show little difference. Thus, the performance gaps in certain tasks in the SFT base models do not always carry over to the alignment-tuned models.\n\nAblation on different merge methods. From Tab. 3, we saw that merging two models that have different strengths can be beneficial to performance. To utilize this for the alignment-tuned model as well, we train two models named 'Cand. 1' and 'Cand. 2' using the same training dataset and SFT base model as 'DPO v2' and 'DPO v3' but with different hyper-parameters to maximize each model's respective strengths. We compare 'Cand. 1' and 'Cand. 2' in Tab. 6 where we can see that 'Cand. 1' has high GSM8K scores but relatively low scores for the other tasks, whereas 'Cand. 2' has low scores for GSM8K but high scores for the other tasks. We merge these two models using various methods and ablate the results in Tab. 7.\n\nWe use two merge methods: 1) Average (a, b), where a and b denote the weighting for 'Cand. 1' and 'Cand. 2' when averaging weights and 2) SLERP (Shoemake, 1985). We use (0.5, 0.5), (0.4, 0.6), and (0.6, 0.4) for Average (a, b). From Tab. 7, we can see that the different merge methods have little effect on the H6 scores. The scores for the individual tasks also do not differ by much, suggesting that as long as the merge candidates have sufficiently different strengths, the exact merge method may not be as crucial.

Containers and packaging can use plastics with a certain percentage of recycled content and designed to be recyclable or reusable. Highly recyclable packaging is of little benefit if it is not disposed of correctly.

This requires investment and innovation since quality and availability are still often a stumbling block for companies to use recycled plastic. The recyclability of plastic packaging can often be improved by:\n\n- choosing a common type of plastic (such as PE, PP or PET);\n- choosing a common color (white or transparent); and\n- avoiding combinations of materials, such as plastic windows in cardboard packaging.

Here I review the history of trout fishing and fly-fishing with special focus on the Rocky Mountain West, where fly fishers first exerted their influence on conservation ethics and sportfishing policy. Although many individuals and organizations played roles, I concentrate on only two: Fly Fishers International (FFI) and Trout Unlimited (TU). These two organizations had similar interests in conservation, but important differences prevented them from working together on a unified goal of conservation. The legacy of fly-fishing demonstrates the importance of passion, persistence, and partnerships in fish conservation.\n\nTrout and salmon are the only sport fish native to the Western states, and fly-fishing here became more than a leisure activity. Norman Maclean's novel, A River Runs through It (1976), begins, \"In our family there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.\" Later Maclean writes that \"Something within fishermen\u00b9 tries to make fishing into a world perfect and apart.\" The iconography of Western fly-fishing that Maclean and others wrote about was created by anglers, fisheries managers, tourists, guides, businesses, and region promoters. The history of Rocky Mountain fly-fishing parallels the history of the expansion of our Western frontier as well as fisheries management (Brown 2015). Although Henry David Thoreau (1862) maintained that \"In wildness is the preservation of the world,\" humans are part of the trout fishing system and helped create, destroy, maintain, and restore the trout fishing we have today.\n\nThe first trout fishers were Native Americans. Native Americans used a variety of fishing methods, including weirs, spears, nets, traps, baskets, hook-and-line methods, and baits. They also caught fish by hand via tickling. Tickling for trout involves rubbing the underbelly of a trout with fingers to get the trout to go into a trance, after which they can then easily be thrown onto the bank (Martindale 1901). Native Americans were more patient than others. This method is different from noodling for catfish, where the noodler uses fingers as bait and grabs the catfish by its mouth. Native Americans also caught fish by fly-fishing with deer-hair flies, according to the writings of early American naturalist William Bartram (1739-1823) (Monahan, no date).\n\nThe story of Rocky Mountain trout fishing begins with displacement of Native Americans from their historical fishing and hunting grounds. Uninhabited wilderness had to be created through the dispossession of Native people before it could be preserved (Spence 1999). Explorers, trappers, pioneers, soldiers, and homesteaders brought fishing gear to frontier outposts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) included a designated angler named Silas Goodrich. The expedition first described several new species of fish, including the Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout, caught by Goodrich. Later military expeditions spent time trout fishing in addition to fighting Native Americans. Custer's Last Stand at Little Bighorn might have been avoided if he'd joined a column of reinforcements under General George Crook. Crook's soldiers were comfortably camped close by on Goose Creek near the Tongue River\u2014fishing, not fighting (Monnett 1993; Owens 2002a; Lessner 2010).\n\n\u00b9 Although Maclean and other writers use the term fishermen, women are active anglers and contribute significantly to the sport.\n\nFly-Fishing's Legacy for Conservation | 191", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000005.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 432, "y": 0}, {"x": 432, "y": 648}, {"x": 0, "y": 648}], "category": "heading1", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "CHAPTER 1", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 137, "y": 310}, {"x": 306.3804999999999, "y": 310}, {"x": 306.3804999999999, "y": 319.5}, {"x": 137, "y": 319.5}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 1, "content": {"text": "FIGURE 1.5.

It seemed a remarkable opportunity to make this anecdotal and analytical contribution to social science: they had each lived in the same space with the same people for the same period. It was to be an experiment made in heaven, that is, within an impeccable laboratory. But my parents had been too distressed by their loss of freedom and the congested and pressured atmosphere of life in camp to collaborate.\n\nBecause I wanted to keep the focus on my own memories, and the tone of voice my own, I wrote my own book with only minimal research in various archives in Australia and abroad. I did some research as a check on some important facts.\n\nAsked to speak about my book at an academic conference at the University of Queensland in 2006, I did some further research to validate my contribution.

As we already know, if Player 2 is the weak type and Player 1 has chosen to invade, then Player 2 should concede. If he is the strong type, then Player 2 should fight. We also know that Player 1 recognizes that she gets a payoff of $0 if she concedes in the first round, regardless of Player 2's type. If she instead chooses to invade in the first round, then Player 1's expected payoff from invading is $p - 0.2(1 - p) = 1.2p - 0.2$. This is merely the weighted average of Player 1's expected payoff when Player 2 is weak and her expected payoff when Player 2 is strong. Thus, invade is a better strategy than concede for Player 1 when $1.2p - 0.2 > 0 \\implies p > 1/6$. In other words, if the probability that Player 1 assigns to Player 2 being weak is greater than one-sixth, Player 1 should choose to invade in the first round. Otherwise, Player 1 should concede and be done with it.\n\nWhat's the outcome when you and your classmates play this more complicated version of the Escalation Game?", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 56, "y": 581}, {"x": 206.535, "y": 581}, {"x": 206.535, "y": 592}, {"x": 56, "y": 592}], "category": "heading1", "id": 1, "content": {"text": "BURNING BRIDGES GAME", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 56, "y": 292.5205015075377}, {"x": 554.5993985000001, "y": 292.5205015075377}, {"x": 554.5993985000001, "y": 304.38604120603014}, {"x": 56, "y": 304.38604120603014}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 2, "content": {"text": "This game shares starkly similar features with the Escalation Game, but there is no uncertainty (thus, the analytical equilibrium is an SPE rather than a PBE).

MoE models offer notable benefits, including enhanced output diversity, allowing for the capture of intricate patterns within the input space. Moreover, their computational efficiency, especially when implemented in a sparse form, has made them valuable in scenarios where resource constraints are a consideration (Shazeer et al., 2017; Komatsuzaki et al., 2022).\n\nHowever, efficient implementation of MoE models poses a considerable challenge, primarily due to the intricacies associated with dynamic routing and load-imbalanced computation (Gale et al., 2023). Existing hardware and software for deep learning, such as TPUs and XLA compilers, often demand static knowledge of tensor shapes, making MoE implementation on TPU challenging.\n\nWhile GPU implementation offers more flexibility, sparse computation compatibility becomes a hurdle. Striking the right balance between fixing the size of each expert to facilitate efficient computation and maintaining model quality creates a tradeoff between information preservation and hardware efficiency. This tradeoff, in turn, necessitates careful consideration during hyperparameter tuning, adding a layer of complexity to the implementation of MoE models, potentially offsetting their advantages. Given the formidable challenges in MoE model implementation, it becomes almost inevitable for researchers and practitioners to resort to specialized tools and frameworks, such as Tutel (Hwang et al., 2023) or Megablocks (Gale et al., 2023).\n\nDeparting from the horizontal expansion characteristic of MoE models, the DUS method intro-", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000189.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}], "category": "table", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "", "html": "<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Alpaca-GPT4</th><th>OpenOrca</th><th>Synth.

Ultrafeedback Clean and Synth. Math-Alignment datasets are used. We name ablated models with the 'DPO' prefix to indicate the alignment tuning stage.

However, the task scores vary more as 'SFT v2' gets a substantially higher GSM8K score of 57.32 compared to 52.24 of 'SFT v1' but also gets noticeably lower scores across the board for ARC, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA.

Building on this intuition, we merge 'SFT v3' and 'SFT v4' as they are the best-performing models with and without OpenOrca. To our surprise, the resulting merged model 'SFT v3+v4' retains the high scores for non-GSM8K tasks from 'SFT v4' but also achieves a higher GSM8K score than 'SFT v3' or 'SFT v4'.

The ideal that it serve as the gateway to political power of disadvantaged groups has been lost due to vague provisions in the law and subsequent Supreme Court decisions. The party list system has also been \"co-opted by the traditional political system or have become the training ground for future influence-peddling traditional politicians\" (Tigno 2019). In other words, it has deviated from the idea of proportional representation practiced in other countries. Dynastic families took advantage of the system's flaws and used them to field relatives, including some women, to expand their political power.

But I could not find Steinkirche, even in old German records of Silesia. The Polish-German Gazeteer, which has a remarkable list of old German place-names in relation to their Polish replacements, and vice versa, gave the names for many places, including M\u00e4rzdorf where my mother had worked as a young woman, on an estate near the Oder River. But there was nothing for Steinkirche. The people assembling the directory must have thought it simply the description of a stone church, as the name suggests, rather than the actual name for the place where the church stood.\n\nObviously it was not an important village. No one in our extended family could give me the Polish names for rural Steinkirche or of Neumarkt Platz in the Silesian metropolis. Had Steinkirche been north, east, west or south of Breslau? In my mind's eye I assumed it to be east\u2014towards Posen\u2014 mistakenly, so I was to discover. In answer to one of my many questions, I recalled that my mother had once told me that it had taken her about an hour by train to travel to the school she attended briefly in Breslau. It was an important clue.\n\nI then rang my cousin, Peter Erlanger, but neither he nor his older sister could help me. Peter advised me to try to find Steinkirche using my computer's Internet search engine. It was enlightened advice, and was to provide me with a key clue. The website yielded a huge list of entries, mostly concerning stone churches in present-day Germany. But there was also a reference to a 1928 visit by a church official inspecting a number of communities overseen by the Lutheran Church at Strehlen. I had often heard my mother and her sister refer to acquaintances in Strehlen.\n\nThe article about Steinkirche described it as having a 1264 Polish Catholic foundation, on a site where pagan sacrifices had taken place.

Let's start with interphase, which is broken into three stages. In the first growth phase (G1), the cell grows and prepares to duplicate its DNA.

Roces (2012, 6) attributes this to the burgeoning student movement and activism, so much so that by the time Marcos declared martial law, women were prepared to take on the resistance. Though inspired by North America's second-wave feminists, Filipino women were also drawn to the era's discourses and contexts, such as the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement.\n\nThe women's movement continued to flourish in the Cory Aquino regime (1986\u20131992). The democratic transition provided political opportunity structures and venues ensuring women's access to the state and nonstate spheres. The drafting of the 1987 Constitution was one such opportunity. The movement managed to advocate for important provisions paving the way for women's rights legislation from the 1980s to the present. The provision in the 1987 Constitution mandates the state to recognize \"the role of women in nation building and shall ensure the fundamental equality before the law of men and women\" (Article 2, Section 14). This provision is said to be unique and is not even found in other countries' charters (Masilungan n.d.).\n\nThe post-Marcos period advanced the participation of women not only in civil society and nongovernment organizations but also in formal politics and bureaucracy. Several women from the movement joined formal politics, while others were invited by the Aquino and Ramos governments (1992\u20131998) to executive posts. The entry of women activists, NGO leaders, and those from the academe ensured that the new democracy would significantly help push measures promoting women's rights and gender equality.

Three final experiments tested the effects of money on social intimacy, desire to engage in\nleisure activities alone, and preference to work alone. As expected, participants who were primed with\nmoney ahead of time were subsequently less socially intimate and exhibited a stronger preference for\nengaging in leisure activities and working alone.\n\nSo yes, Vohs et al.'s experiments suggest that money makes Homo sapiens feel self-sufficient and\nbehave accordingly.", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 56, "y": 511}, {"x": 256.591, "y": 511}, {"x": 256.591, "y": 522}, {"x": 56, "y": 522}], "category": "heading1", "id": 1, "content": {"text": "PRICE AND THE PLACEBO EFFECT", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 42, "y": 536}, {"x": 554.6050999999999, "y": 536}, {"x": 554.6050999999999, "y": 547}, {"x": 42, "y": 547}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 2, "content": {"text": "Is it possible that the magnitudes of placebo effects experienced by Homo sapiens (e.g., through medical\ntherapies or medications) are somehow influenced by the prices we pay for them?

These advancements bring challenges such as the increased need to train ever larger models (Rae et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023; Lian, 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Gesmundo and Maile, 2023) owing to the performance scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021; Anil et al., 2023; Kaddour et al., 2023). To efficiently tackle the above, recent works in scaling language models such as a mixture of experts (MoE) (Shazeer et al., 2017; Komatsuzaki et al., 2022) have been proposed. While those approaches are able to effi-ciently and effectively scale-up LLMs, they often require non-trivial changes to the training and inference framework (Gale et al., 2023), which hinders widespread applicability. Effectively and efficiently scaling up LLMs whilst also retaining the simplicity for ease of use is an important problem (Alberts et al., 2023; Fraiwan and Khasawneh, 2023; Sallam et al., 2023; Bahrini et al., 2023).\n\nInspired by Komatsuzaki et al. (2022), we present depth up-scaling (DUS), an effective and efficient method to up-scale LLMs whilst also remaining straightforward to use. DUS consists of scaling the number of layers in the base model and continually pretraining the scaled model. Unlike (Komatsuzaki et al., 2022), DUS does not scale the model using MoE and rather use a depthwise scaling method analogous to Tan and Le (2019) which is adapted for the LLM architecture. Thus, there are no additional modules or dynamism as with MoE, making DUS immediately compatible with easy-to-use LLM frameworks such as HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2019) with no changes to the training or inference framework for maximal efficiency. Furthermore, DUS is applicable to all transformer architectures, opening up new gateways to effectively and efficiently scale-up LLMs in a simple manner. Using DUS, we release SOLAR 10.7B, an LLM with 10.7 billion parameters, that outperforms existing models like Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) in various benchmarks.\n\nWe have also developed SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct, a variant fine-tuned for tasks requiring strict adherence to complex instructions. It significantly outperforms the Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct model across various evaluation metrics, evidencing an advanced proficiency that exceeds the capabilities of even larger models in terms of benchmark performance.\n\nBy releasing SOLAR 10.7B under the Apache 2.0 license, we aim to promote collaboration and innovation in NLP.

It was in my first year as Open Education Librarian that the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 810 (SB810), which requires institutions of higher education across the state to provide searchable information to students about OER-only courses. A strong definition of OER was provided:\n\n> \"teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that allows for free use, reuse, modification, and sharing with others, including full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.\"\n\nHowever, Texas was not given a very long implementation window. The bill passed in June 2017, effective immediately, with a compliance deadline of Spring 2018. We in higher education know a change of this scope, and impacting as many stakeholders as course marking does, takes longer. A recent survey commissioned by the Digital Higher Education Consortium of Texas (DigiTex) and administered in May 2019 shows only 59 respondents of the 158 two-and four-year institutions that received the statewide survey have a course marking solution in place.

Because it takes a long time for scientists to obtain needed life history information, fisheries-independent survey data, and catch history, grouper populations may be overfished long before data are even available for a stock assessment. Without formal stock assessments, general indicators of population status are based on catch trends. Very few grouper stocks that have spawning aggregations are managed sustainably.

The effectiveness will depend on traits of the species and the local context. Regulations to prevent marketing of undersize fish will mitigate growth overfishing. Allowing smaller fish to reach maturity at least once before harvest will mitigate recruitment overfishing. Size-limit regulations focused on protecting spawning-size fish may be ineffective for deepwater recreational fishing. Grouper have a physoclistous (i.e., closed) swim bladder, making them particularly susceptible to ruptured swim bladders, bloating, stomach distention, and protruding eyes caused by rapid decompression when hauled to the surface (Brul\u00e9 et al. 2015).

If f is a function then we will write Df as the new function that is the derivative of f:^5\n\n$$(Df)(t) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\\bigg|_{x=t}.$$\n\nTo do this for the Lagrange equation we need to construct a function to take the derivative of.\n\nGiven a configuration-space path w, there is a standard way to make the state-space path. We can abstract this method as a mathematical function \u0393:\n\n$$\u0393[w](t) = (t, w(t), \\frac{d}{dt}w(t)).$$\n\nUsing \u0393 we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}((\u2202_2L)(\u0393[w](t))) - (\u2202_1L)(\u0393[w](t)) = 0.$$\n\nIf we now define composition of functions (f \u2218 g)(x) = f(g(x)), we can express the Lagrange equations entirely in terms of functions:\n\n$$D((\u2202_2L) \u2218 (\u0393[w])) - (\u2202_1L) \u2218 (\u0393[w]) = 0.$$\n\nThe functions \u2202_1L and \u2202_2L are partial derivatives of the function L. Composition with \u0393[w] evaluates these partials with coordinates and velocites appropriate for the path w, making functions of time. Applying D takes the time derivative. The Lagrange equation states that the difference of the resulting functions of time must be zero. This statement of the Lagrange equation is complete, unambiguous, and functional. It is not encumbered with the particular choices made in expressing the Lagrangian. For example, it doesn't matter if the time is named t or \u03c4, and it has an explicit place for the path to be tested.\n\nThis expression is equivalent to a computer program:^6\n\n----\n\n^5 An explanation of functional derivatives is in Appendix B, page 202.\n\n^6 The programs in this book are written in Scheme, a dialect of Lisp.

We used the Qualtrics platform to facilitate the ease of dissemination and response from home computers, iPads or mobile phone survey options. Qualtrics, one of the most widely used research platforms, supports the implementation of both large-scale survey and experimental study designs. It is administered online with responses gathered into a central and privacy protected database that only the approved researchers have access to.\n\nThe platform allows for the easy migration of data into various statistical packages, including STATA, the main statistical analysis package that we will use to analyse the data. A limitation of this study is that we were unable to translate the survey in all ASEAN languages, and there is a selection bias in that we are focussing the survey in areas of the region that most experience violent extremism and terrorism. However, through our networks, where possible, we disseminated the survey throughout all ASEAN countries.\n\nIt is important to note the limitations of this six-month study. Although the survey was disseminated among all member states, the majority of expert respondents came from Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. While this can be regarded as highly selective rather than representative, it is important to note that Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand are the countries that continue to face the most pressing threat of ongoing violent extremism and conflict.\n\nThis is with the exception of Myanmar.

If the statement in Definition 4 is fulfilled, then clearly among such\nscenarios, the monotonic ones (LH and HL) are the by far most probable ones.\nThus, since universes with high entropy at both ends would seem to be quite\nuninhabitable, one can argue that given the existence of an observer, then with\nalmost certainty he must live in a universe with monotonic entropy.\n\nSumming up, both limits above can be used to argue in favor of time asymmetry.\nNevertheless, at least to the mind of the author, the strong broken symmetry is the\npreferable one.

Among those who fish for sport, only 27% of U.S. anglers are female (Burkett and Carter 2020). Underrepresentation of females in sportfishing is ironic, as the first publication on fly-fishing, dating from the 15th century, was written by Dame Juliana Berners, entitled Treatyse of Fysshynge with an Angle, a publication that heavily influenced novelty of the sport for European enthusiasts. Though sometimes invisible, women are slowly changing the world of sportfishing by breaking stereotypes. Future growth of sportfishing will rely on female anglers, instructors, and guides. Here I share a few examples on women making a substantial impact through their passion toward fishing. These examples demonstrate women who loved and valued what they did. If the paucity of female role models discourages females from seeing the relevance of fishing to them, these examples should inspire.\n\nFrederick Buller (2013) chronicled the very long list of large Atlantic Salmon caught by female anglers, which are outnumbered 200 to 1 by male salmon anglers. Georgina Ballantine holds the British record for a 64-pound rod-caught Atlantic Salmon from River Tay, Scotland, in 1922 (Figure 7.5). Joan Wulff was introduced to fly-fishing by her father when she was ten and won several fly-fishing accuracy championships before winning the 1951 Fishermen's Distance competition against all-male competitors. She became the first female spokesperson for Garcia Corporation in 1959 and advocated for women anglers in her writings for Outdoor Life and Rod & Reel. Today, females make up 30% of participants in the sport of fly-fishing (Recreational Fishing and Boating Foundation 2021). Joan Wulff participated in many distance casting events and did trick casting. She snapped a cigarette from the mouth of Johnny Carson on the TV show \"Who Do You Trust?\" (Fogt 2017). Starting in 1978, Wulff opened a fly-casting school on the Upper Beaverkill River in New York. Her Fly-Casting Techniques, published in 1987, and New Fly-Casting Techniques, published in 2012, are classic guides to learning her techniques. When asked about her favorite fish, she would respond, \"Whatever I'm fishing for,\" and her favorite place to fish was \"Wherever I am.\"\n\nThe image shows a woman in a long coat and hat holding a fishing rod. The caption reads: Figure 7.5: Georgina Ballantine holds the British record for a 64-pound rod-caught salmon from River Tay, Scotland in 1922.\n\nMost avid bass anglers can identify Roland Martin, Bill Dance, and Jimmy Houston, who dominated competitive bass fishing in the first decade of Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.) and have had TV fishing shows for decades. Kim Bain-Moore began competing in bass tournaments at age 19 and in 2009 became the first woman to compete in the Bassmaster Classic tournament. Only three females have been inducted into the Bass Fishing Hall of Fame. The first was Christine Houston, who organized the first-ever all women's bass club, the \"Tulsa Bass Belles.\" But female participation in competitive bass fishing never took off as expected. Fewer that one in five readers of Field & Stream, Outdoor Life, and Bassmaster magazines are female (Carini and Weber 2017).\n\nGender and Fishing | 155", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000100.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}], "category": "table", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "", "html": "<table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Anonymous</th><th>Observable</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>House</td><td>2.5%</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Apartment</td><td>5%</td><td>11.5%</td></tr></tbody></table>", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}], "category": "table", "id": 1, "content": {"text": "", "html": "<table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Anonymous</th><th>Observable</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Renter</td><td>4.5%</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Owner</td><td>2.5%</td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table>", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 56, "y": 63.621217008014256}, {"x": 554.6735301, "y": 63.621217008014256}, {"x": 554.6735301, "y": 78.46761059661621}, {"x": 56, "y": 78.46761059661621}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 2, "content": {"text": "(Yoeli et al. 2013)\n\nOn a final note, Yoeli et al. provide evidence that indirect reciprocity among Homo sapiens is unique to public goods.

IRAS was equipped with a 0.6-meter telescope cooled to a temperature of less than 10 K. For the first time, the infrared sky could be seen as if it were night, rather than through a bright foreground of atmospheric and telescope emissions. IRAS carried out a rapid but comprehensive survey of the entire infrared sky over a 10-month period, cataloging about 350,000 sources of infrared radiation. Since then, several other infrared telescopes have operated in space with much better sensitivity and resolution due to improvements in infrared detectors. The most powerful of these infrared telescopes is the 0.85-meter Spitzer Space Telescope, which launched in 2003. A few of its observations are shown in Figure 2.

In his Dictionary, Johnson indicates the Arabic origin of coffee and rightly so, as one the most popular types of coffee is called \"Arabica\" because it was first domesticated for commercial use in the southern part of Arabia the Happy (present-day Yemen). Given the Muslim prohibition of alcohol, coffee became particularly attractive to the Muslim world as \"the wine of Islam,\"26 and spread through the ports of the Persian Gulf in Western Europe, where it became immensely popular. Collections of travels published during the time mention that coffee was \"the product of Arabia only.\"27 Imported largely from Yemen, which was credited with producing the best coffee in the world, coffee was considered to have stimulating and therapeutic properties.28 The former quality is famously described by Pope in The Rape of the Lock: \"Coffee (which makes the politician wise), / And see thro' all things with his half-shut Eyes) / Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain / New Stratagems, the radiant Lock to gain.\"29 According to Beawes, the product was brought to Mecca through the port of Jeddah, whose \"[t]rade consists mainly of coffee brought here by the Arabians and bought by the\n\nFigure 4.2 William Hogarth, Taste in High Life \n\nTurks ... [and] by the Merchants of Mogul, Persia, and several places on the coast of Ehiopia.\"30 From here, coffee spread rapidly in England, France, and Italy, giving rise to the coffeehouse culture that is a hallmark of the eighteenth century. Coffee was also regularly paired in the visual culture of the time with expensive china (fig. 4.2), was employed as a mark of the culture of sociability (fig. 4.3), or was used for its oracular properties31 (fig. 4.4).\n\nArabian medicines were also much sought-after in the Western world. As indicated by Beawes, \"from Arabia, Medicinal drugs, Dragon's Blood, Manna, Myrrh, [and] Incense,\"32 were brought to the British metropolis.

Freshwater megafauna face many threats, and 71% of these species are in decline (He et al. 2017, 2018). Arapaima continue to face intense fishing throughout their range (Watson et al. 2021). However, freshwater megafauna like the Arapaima have fewer conservation resources and efforts than marine or terrestrial megafaunas.\n\nFishing, in general, and fishing for Arapaima in particular, is a central element of the local economy and culture in Amazonia. Because these fish are obligate breathers, they are traditionally harvested by fishers using harpoons at the time when they surface to breathe. Men typically fish from canoes and search for signs of Arapaima near the surface. As they near the Arapaima, the harpooner throws the harpoon by hand. This is a specialized type of fishing, and the local fishers possess knowledge of the behavior that increases their likelihood of catching one. With appropriate training, fishers' participation in management processes can contribute to the conservation and governance of these small-scale fisheries.\n\nMany populations of Arapaima have been driven to local extinction due to overfishing (Castello et al. 2015a; Gurdak 2019a; Watson et al. 2021; Freitas and Sousa 2021). Much of the catch is illegal, with most specimens being caught below the minimum size limit or during the closed season (Cavole et al. 2015). The small-scale fishers are geographically dispersed, and governments in these regions have insufficient resources to devote to enforcing fishing rules. The riverine fishers who target Arapaima are marginalized and have limited formal education. Yet, compliance with regulations is essential to prevent overfishing and local extinction.\n\nArapaima represent only a small fraction of the fisheries harvest, but they are culturally important and symbolic as a flagship genus of tropical South American fisheries and floodplain management and conservation. Reducing the threats to Arapaima will also provide protections for many of the highly migratory fish of the Amazon basin. Collectively, the migratory fish contribute most of the fishery's landings in the basin (Duponchelle et al. 2021). Migratory fish depend on multiple, distant, but interconnected habitats during their life cycle. Any threat to one of the habitats or the corridor that connects them can influence these important food fish (Goulding et al. 2019).\n\nIntegrating Fishers in the Management of Arapaima | 251", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000078.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 99, "y": 80.88999999999999}, {"x": 394.7948000000001, "y": 80.88999999999999}, {"x": 394.7948000000001, "y": 92.88999999999999}, {"x": 99, "y": 92.88999999999999}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "Figure 1.10.

Long description.\n\nToday most tuna are captured in purse seines, and longlines are the second-most-common gear. Indonesia and Japan are consistently the top-two fishing nations (Figure 12.8). Five of the top tuna fishing nations\u2014Japan, Taiwan (Republic of China), Spain, Korea, and the USA\u2014have large fishing fleets that operate far from their home waters, whereas the others have large local or regional fleets. New technologies, such as sonar, have made tuna fishing much more effective. In response, the use of spotter planes is banned for fishing Atlantic Bluefin Tuna in the Mediterranean (Di Natale 2020). Many recreational tuna boats also use spotter planes in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, although the traditionalist harpoon fishers shun the technology (Whynott 1995; Decker 2016).\n\nThe Pacific Ocean has consistently had the highest landings, about 66% of the world's tuna catch. The western and central Pacific Ocean is where many artisanal and industrial fisheries overlap. For the small island nations, fishing provides a major source of income, jobs, and food security (Bell et al. 2019). Yet, Pacific island nations have not fully realized the economic potential with the global tuna industry, despite the fact that 80% of it is caught within their exclusive economic zones (EEZs, i.e., within 200 miles). The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea awarded coastal states sovereign rights to (1) exploit and manage all living resources within their EEZ, (2) exclude distant water fleets in favor of developing their own fleets, and (3) charge distant water fleets rent for access. Eight island nations\u2014the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, which support 80% of the purse-seine catch in their waters\u2014formed an alliance and require collective bargaining to set rents for access by foreign vessels. The alliance also prioritized domestic over foreign vessels and set limits on the number of purse-seine vessels. The issue of sovereignty over tuna that migrate freely among EEZs remains a concern for small island nations (Bailey et al. 2012). Working to establish fair and equitable allocations of total allowable catches to the many parties will require more equitable sharing with the larger tuna-fishing nations.\n\n282 | Conserving Tuna: The Most Commercially Valuable Fish on Earth", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000025.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 295, "y": 64.30700000000002}, {"x": 365.176, "y": 64.30700000000002}, {"x": 365.176, "y": 72.30700000000002}, {"x": 295, "y": 72.30700000000002}], "category": "heading1", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "2.

Few of the artefacts were authentically part of this area. It told us nothing of any interest or with any authority. We wondered whose culture we were looking at.\n\nAt the central railway station, we tried to question officials, in German and English, about the location of Steinkirche. But only Polish was spoken at the information office and other counters. Nor could we locate the correct train line on the information screens.\n\nOn our walk back to the centre of town, past the dilapidated theatre where my mother had attended performances, John spotted another bookshop. Surprisingly it was trading busily on a Polish Catholic Sunday. It sold old maps and books. We found old pictures of Breslau labelled in Polish and English. We found descriptions in both Polish and English of Neumarkt Platz (Novi Targ). Various maps showed clear plans of its location. They also showed the Neptune fountain I had been seeking. For centuries it had a conspicuous place in town maps as a well drawing water from the Oder, whose tributaries flowed together and separated the town into different quarters, spanned by a multitude of bridges.\n\nI was thrilled. Before this find, my family had begun to question whether the fountain had actually existed. 'You and your fountain!' they cried. But I always knew it was there, in my memory and beyond.\n\nWhen we walked to Novi Targ, we found the old houses by the square had been destroyed totally by the War. So, to my disappointment, had the Neptune fountain . In *Microcosm*, his history of Wroclaw, Norman Davies tells how, after the War, the rubble of Breslau had been removed in trainloads to rebuild Warsaw in its original style. Some fine Breslau buildings left standing by War were even knocked down for their old bricks.\n\nI viewed this horrible information as being akin to the punishment Dante dished out to sinners in his Purgatory.

Long description.\n\nCreel limits are one of many elements that may be used by anglers to define fishing success. When more fish are harvested per trip, anglers rate fishing higher. High creel limits may cause anglers to have unrealistic expectations about the potential supply of fish compared to the demand (Cook et al. 2001). Creel limit reductions may be unsuccessful in reducing angler harvest or affecting fish populations. The hypothetical angler success graph (Figure 10.5) demonstrates that a reduction in creel from 8 to 4 would affect only a few trips and result in a small harvest reduction. Furthermore, creel limits are applied on a per-angler basis, so they cannot control total harvest if total fishing effort increases or if noncompliance is high. Finally, since anglers have a variety of motivations, they likely respond differently to regulation changes (Beard et al. 2011).\n\nThe ethic of fairness is involved in setting creel limit regulations because many anglers do not harvest a single fish during an angling trip. In Wisconsin lakes, Walleye harvest was not equally distributed. Only 7.4% of Walleye angler trips were successful in harvesting at least one Walleye, and <1% harvested a limit during a fishing trip (Staggs 1989). In Minnesota, anglers were slightly more successful, where 27.2% of angler trips ended with a harvest of at least one Walleye and about 1% harvesting a limit. The ideal creel limit would distribute the catch among more anglers and prevent overuse by a few individuals.\n\nLong-term trends in panfish populations (i.e., Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass) in Wisconsin lakes showed significant declines due to overfishing (Rypel et al. 2016). The daily limit for panfish was 50 aggregate per day from 1967 through 1998, which was reduced to 25 in 1998. Further reduction in daily limits for panfish (10) to improve undesirable small sizes of Bluegill populations increased both mean length and mean maximum length relative to sizes in control lakes (Jacobson 2005; Rypel et al. 2015).\n\n226 | Recreational Fishing and Keep Fish Wet", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}]}, "01030000000002.pdf": {"elements": [{"coordinates": [{"x": 62, "y": 43.14200000000005}, {"x": 388.166, "y": 43.14200000000005}, {"x": 388.166, "y": 54.14200000000005}, {"x": 62, "y": 54.14200000000005}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 0, "content": {"text": "3\ufffd6                                                                                           Yarrow\n\n\n\nwhere soas below some threshold cannot be recovered, so that an observer\ncan only guess about order.19 However, either kind of model can easily be fitted\nand interpreted from either theoretical perspective.\n\n\n\n8          Choosing between Observer Models and Rejecting Participants\n\n\n\nTwo further reasonable questions one might ask are: 1) could my observer\nmodel have generated these data? and 2) does another observer model de-\nscribe the data better? Model comparison is a large and complex topic, so once\nagain, what I have to say here should be treated as a brief introduction rather\nthan a comprehensive summary.\n    Let\u2019s begin by considering a metric I have not yet mentioned: Deviance. De-\nviance (sometimes called G2) is a measure based on log likelihood, but which\nlooks rather more like summed squared error, in that it is zero for a perfectly\nfitting model and large/positive for a poorly fitting model. Formally, deviance\nis two times the difference in log likelihood between the saturated model and\nthe model with our current set of parameters. A saturated model is one that\nexactly predicts the data (which can always be accomplished by a model that\nhas one parameter per data point). Hence it represents the situation with the\nmaximum possible log-likelihood when predicting this particular set of data.\nDeviance is closely related to a simpler calculation (\u20132 \u00d7 log likelihood) that\nforms the basis of a couple of well-known metrics for model comparison (the\nAkaike information criterion,             aic, and the Bayesian information criterion,\nbic) and indeed is occasionally defined this way. That\u2019s because we are of-\nten only really interested in differences (in Deviance, or aic, or bic) between\nmodels, and the log-likelihood of the saturated model gets subtracted out in a\ncomparison between two models (because it has contributed to the deviance\nin the same way for both) so calculating it is not necessary.\n    However, if you want to say something about the goodness of fit of a model\nwithout relating it to any other model, based on asymptotic statistical theory,\nyou do need to calculate deviance properly. Asymptotically, it turns out that\nthe deviance of a model fitted to data when that model actually generated those\ndata follows a chi-square (\u03c72) distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to\nthe number of data points minus the number of model parameters (note: for\n\n\n\n19      Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez and Alcal\u00e1-Quintana\u2019s commitment to this account is a little unclear, be-\n        cause they often let \u03b4 vary across experimental conditions, suggesting flexibility more\n        akin to a criterion-based account.

The inside area is divided into many parts, each of them with its specific use. It is important to note that a \"well-to-do\" Bedouin tent like the one shown in figure 8.16 indicates the higher status of the family living in it than that of a family living in the humbler, three-poled tent in figure 8.15. These images also show that different areas are used by men and by women.50 For example, the tent contains a space which is allocated to female weavers, like a studio where they perform their craft and practice their skills.51 Thus, in the Bedouin society, the tent is a not only a signifier of social relationships and family status but also of gender roles. It is, therefore, an extremely important space because here women make items that support their family or tribe.\n\nWhile the function of the textile is to create and demarcate the Bedouin space, the way the space is constructed influences the way the nomads live and the way the family or the tribe is perceived by the outside world. The textile is, therefore, structuring the formation of a private and a public identity by delineating the space: the outside, non-patterned textiles are public, while the inside, patterned textiles are private.52 We can infer,\n\n49      For details, see Al-Sabah, Ibjad, 17.\n\n50      See also Dickson, The Arab of the Desert, 66\u201367; and Canavan, \"Applications of Textile Products,\" 541.

The idea, which essentially goes back to Boltzmann (see [12]), is that any given macro-state at any given time is extremely likely to develop into a state with higher entropy at the next moment of time, simply because there are so many more states with higher entropy than with lower entropy (compare with (3)). The problem with this in the present situation, however, is that this way of thinking in fact presupposes a preferred direction of time. Otherwise, given that the dynamical laws are time symmetric, why can we not similarly argue that the entropy should also grow when we go backward in time? (compare [9]).\n\nThere have been many attempts to avoid this problem by looking for defects in the symmetries. But my conclusion here is that we must actually accept Boltzmann's argument in both directions of time and hence we are led to the following:\n\n**Principle 1.** At every moment of time t and for every state with entropy S, there are very many \"accessible states\" with higher entropy, both at the previous moment of time t - 1 and at the next one t + 1. On the other hand, the chance for finding such accessible states with lower entropy, both at times t - 1 and t + 1, is extremely small.\n\nThis principle also implies a shift of perspective in the search for time's arrow. Rather than trying to find the reason for the asymmetry, we must concentrate on understanding why we cannot observe the symmetric structure of the multiverse as a whole.\n\nAs still one more simplification, let us assume that the entropy can only change by \u00b11 during each unit of time. This assumption, however, has to be modified near the endpoints (BB and BC) for the following reason: it is a very important aspect of this approach to assume that physics during the first and last moments is very different from the rest of the time, since at these moments quantum phenomena can be expected to become global. To model this in a simple way, we can split the life-span of our multiverse up into three parts:\n\n$$[-T_0, -T_1] \\cup [-T_1, T_1] \\cup [T_1, T_0].$$\n\nHere the first and last parts may be called \"the extreme phases,\" which are characterized by the property that transition between very different states can be possible.

In The Netherlands, speeding tickets are usually processed in a fully automated fashion, and the perpetrator will receive the tickets within a couple of weeks after the offence. The Dutch police optimized the procedures of speed control such that this effort has become very profitable to the Dutch government. Various strategies for speed control are carried out by police forces, which are all based on the position of the vehicle at consecutive times. The actual velocity follows from the first-order derivative of the position of the vehicle with respect to time. Since no explicit formula for this position is available, the velocity can only be estimated using an approximation of the velocity based on several discrete vehicle positions at discrete times. This motivates the use of approximate derivatives, also called numerical derivatives. If the police want to know whether the offender drove faster before speed detection (in other words, whether the perpetrator hit the brakes after having seen the police patrol), or whether the driver was already accelerating, then they are also interested in the acceleration of the 'bad guy'. This acceleration can be estimated using numerical approximations of the second-order derivative of the car position with respect to time.\n\nSince the time-interval of recording is nonzero, the velocity is not determined exactly in general. In this chapter, the resulting error, referred to as the truncation error, is estimated using Taylor series. In most cases, the truncation error increases with an increasing size of the recording interval (Sections 3.2 and 3.4). Next to the truncation error, the measurement of the position of the vehicle is also prone to measurement errors. Issues that influence the results are, for example, parallax, the measurement equipment, and in some cases even the performance of the police officer (in car-videoing and laser control). These measurement errors provide an additional deterioration of the approximation of the speed and acceleration.

The type indicates the training stage of the model and is chosen from {Pretrained, Instruction-tuned, Alignment-tuned}. Models based on SOLAR 10.7B are colored purple. The best scores for H6 and the individual tasks are shown in bold.\n\nMetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2023) dataset.\nWe reformatted the instruction datasets with an Alpaca-styled chat template. For datasets such as OpenOrca, which are derived from FLAN (Long-pre et al., 2023), we filter data that overlaps with the benchmark datasets (see Tab. 8 in Appendix. C for more information). The alignment datasets are in the {prompt, chosen, rejected} triplet format. We preprocess the alignment datasets following Zephyr (Tunstall et al., 2023). We use Data-verse (Park et al., 2024) for data preprocessing.\n\nEvaluation. In the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023), six types of evaluation methods are presented: ARC (Clark et al., 2018), HellaSWAG (Zellers et al., 2019), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). We utilize these datasets as benchmarks for evaluation and also report the average scores for the six tasks, e.g., H6. We either submit directly to the Open LLM Leader-board or utilize Evalverse (Kim et al., 2024b) for running evaluations locally.\n\nModel merging. Model merging methods such as Yadav et al. (2023) can boost model performance without further training. We merge some of the models that we trained in both the instruction and alignment tuning stages. We implement our own merging methods although popular open source also exist such as MergeKit\u00b3.\n\n4.2 Main Results\n\nWe present evaluation results for our SOLAR 10.7B and SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct models along\n\n\u00b3https://github.com/cg123/mergekit\n\nwith other top-performing models in Tab. 2. SO-LAR 10.7B outperforms other pretrained models of similar sizes, such as Qwen 14B and Mistral 7B, which shows that DUS is an effective method to up-scale base LLMs. Furthermore, despite the smaller size, SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct scores the highest in terms of H6, even surpassing the recent top-performing open-source LLM Mixtral 8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 or Qwen 72B. The above results indicate DUS can up-scale models that are capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned. We also report data contamination results for SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct in Appendix C.\n\n4.3 Ablation Studies\n\nWe present ablation studies for both the instruction and alignment tuning stages. Note that the evaluation results for the following studies are ran locally and may vary from results obtained by submitting to the Open LLM Leaderboard.\n\n4.3.1 Instruction Tuning\n\nAblation on the training datasets. We present ablation studies using different training datasets for the instruction tuning in Tab. 3. The ablated models are prefixed with SFT for supervised fine-tuning. 'SFT v1' only uses the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, whereas 'SFT v2' also uses the OpenOrca dataset. 'SFT v3' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v2'. Similarly, 'SFT v4' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v1'.\n\nFirst, we analyze how Alpaca-GPT4 and OpenOrca affect the trained models.

The thought experiments in Section 1 are, for the most part, re-castings of the simple cognitive tests devised by psychologists and economists over the past three-to-four decades to illustrate the fallacies, miscalculations, and biases distinguishing Homo sapiens from Homo economicus. Similarly, the laboratory experiments presented in Section 2 are, for the most part, re-castings of the seminal experiments conducted by Kahneman and Tversky (among many others). These experiments helped motivate the revised theories of human choice behavior, such as Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) Prospect Theory, which form another pillar of behavioral economics. Alongside these experiments, Section 2 presents the revised theories of human choice behavior with varying degrees of rigor. This is where the theoretical bases of Homo economicus' rational choice behavior are examined, and where key refinements to this theory are developed\u2014theoretical refinements underpinning the myriad departures from rational choice behavior we witness Homo sapiens make in this section's laboratory and field experiments (and which are examined further in Sections 3 and 4).\n\nSection 3 submerses the student in the world of behavioral game theory. Here we explore games such as Ultimatum Bargaining presented in Example 5. We follow Camerer (2003)'s lead, first by characterizing the games analytically (i.e., identifying solution, or equilibrium, concepts that are predicted to result when members of Homo economicus play the games), and then by discussing empirical results obtained from corresponding field experiments conducted with Homo sapiens. It is within the context of these games and field experiments that theories of social interaction are tested concerning inter alia trust and trustworthiness, honesty, fairness, reciprocity, etc. As with the thought and laboratory experiments presented in Sections 1 and 2, the games and field experiments presented in Section 3 are meant to be replicated with students as subjects and the instructor as the experimenter, or researcher.\n\nFinally, Section 4 wades into the vast sea of empirical research and choice architecture. Here the student explores studies reporting on (1) the outcomes of actual policy nudges, such as the SMarT retirement-savings plan presented in Example 3 of the Introduction, (2) analyses of secondary datasets to test for choice behavior consistent with the revised theories discussed in Section 2, such as the test for loss aversion in Example 4 of the Introduction, and (3) analyses of primary datasets obtained from novel field experiments to further test the revised theories. The main purpose of this section is not only to introduce the student to interesting empirical studies and policy adaptations in the field of behavioral economics, but also, in the process, to incubate in the student an abiding appreciation for the obscure settings that sometimes lend themselves to such study.\u00b3", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 612, "y": 0}, {"x": 612, "y": 792}, {"x": 0, "y": 792}], "category": "heading1", "id": 1, "content": {"text": "THE TEXTBOOK'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RIGOR", "html": "", "markdown": ""}}, {"coordinates": [{"x": 56, "y": 613}, {"x": 554.6054396000002, "y": 613}, {"x": 554.6054396000002, "y": 624}, {"x": 56, "y": 624}], "category": "paragraph", "id": 2, "content": {"text": "Because the mathematical and computational rigor of material presented in this textbook varies throughout, particularly in Sections 2 \u2013 4, the extent of the rigor used in the presentation of a given topic is indicated with superscripts.

This final designing phase was directed at cooperation between the children: they had to agree on how to design the park and work together in order to be able to realize their ideas (interview with Heeswijk, 2007). To realize their ideas, players thus needed to communicate and cooperate. The discussion option of the game was facilitated through a chat function.

At slightly more than 36 metric tons per person per year, Canadians generate roughly 10 tons more MSW per person annually than the next highest garbage producers, Bulgarians and Americans (Tiseo, 2021). Summiting a list like this is obviously not in any country's best interest\u2014there are no kudos for reaching the top of the heap, so to speak. Is it therefore possible that those nations reaching the top will take the lead in reversing course?\n\nHalifax is one Canadian city that apparently has. On August 1st, 2015, the city began providing a \"green nudge\" to citizens living in its urban core area with the introduction of the Clear Bag Policy, a policy designed to nudge households toward more responsible sorting of their waste, which, in turn, would result in an overall reduction in the total amount of waste generated. As Akbulut-Yuksel and Boulatoff point out, under the new policy, households were mandated to replace their black garbage bags, traditionally used for the disposal of their refuse, with clear, transparent bags. The Clear Bag Policy allowed households to put out the same number of garbage bags at the curb (six every other week), but all waste destined for the landfill was required to be disposed of in a clear bag (except for one dark bag permitted for privacy's sake). This allowed waste collectors to screen and refuse any bags containing materials that should otherwise have been diverted from the landfill, such as recyclables, food waste, and hazardous waste. Clear bags also made apparent to everyone, neighbors and passersby alike, a given household's waste-generation and disposal habits.\u00b3\u00b3\n\nTo test the Clear Bag Policy's impact on a typical household's generation of MSW, Akbulut-Yuksel and Boulatoff designed a quasi-experiment spanning the period from January 6, 2014, to July 28, 2017, with January 6, 2014, to July 31, 2015, serving as the pre-treatment period and August 1, 2015, to July 28, 2017, serving as the post-treatment period. MSW data collected during this time span\n\n\u00b3\u00b3 As Akbulut-Yuksel and Boulatoff point out, Halifax households are required to sort waste in four ways: (1) recyclable containers (plastics, glass, and aluminum) are put in a transparent blue bag, (2) paper and cardboard are put in a separate bag, (3) organic food waste goes in a green bin provided by the city, and (4) the remaining waste (refuse) goes into garbage bags. Recyclable materials are collected each week, while garbage and organic waste are each collected every other week on opposite weeks (except in the summer months when, thank goodness, organic waste is collected on a weekly basis).\n\n234 ARTHUR J.

Rather than using canned programs purely as an\naid to visualization or numerical computation, we use computer\nprogramming in a functional style to encourage clear thinking.\nProgramming forces us to be precise and unambiguous, without\nforcing us to be excessively rigorous. The computer does not toler-\nate vague descriptions or incomplete constructions. Thus the act\nof programming makes us keenly aware of our errors of reasoning\nor unsupported conclusions.1\n   Although this book is about differential geometry, we can show\nhow thinking about programming can help in understanding in a\nmore elementary context. The traditional use of Leibniz\u2019s notation\nand Newton\u2019s notation is convenient in simple situations, but in\nmore complicated situations it can be a serious handicap to clear\nreasoning.\n   A mechanical system is described by a Lagrangian function of\nthe system state (time, coordinates, and velocities). A motion of\nthe system is described by a path that gives the coordinates for\neach moment of time. A path is allowed if and only if it satisfies\nthe Lagrange equations. Traditionally, the Lagrange equations are\nwritten\n d  \u2202L\u2212 \u2202L       = 0.\ndt\u2202 \u02d9 q     \u2202q\nWhat could this expression possibly mean?\n   Let\u2019s try to write a program that implements Lagrange equa-\ntions. What are Lagrange equations for? Our program must take\na proposed path and give a result that allows us to decide if the\npath is allowed.       This is already a problem; the equation shown\nabove does not have a slot for a path to be tested.\n\n\n\n1The idea of using computer programming to develop skills of clear thinking\nwas originally advocated by Seymour Papert.

For the majority of LGUs in the country, however, there seemed to be no clear documentation and reporting of progress and updated waste data possibly due to the difficulty and complexity of data generation and assessment. Another possible constraint is that the scope of the LGU ordinances vary and covered different kinds of SUPP, including the exemptions, which makes integration of the various reports, if available, a challenge.\"\n\nThe World Bank/PEMSEA report also recommended that a baseline assessment be conducted to obtain a better understanding which SUPP are the most prevalent and problematic in the Philippines and to also identify the sources and extent and impacts of mismanagement.\n\nb. Extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR schemes use a combination of regulatory approaches to extend manufacturers' responsibility for single-use plastic products throughout their life cycle, including to the end-of-life stage. These schemes are aimed at decreasing the overall environmental impact from a product and its packaging. The primary responsibility under EPR lies with the producer, who makes design and marketing decisions. In most European countries, product manufacturers are charged a fee for every piece of packaging they put onto the market based on the reusability or recyclability of the packaging, supported by technical analysis. These fees are intended to cover some or all of the costs of collection, sorting and recycling. Since the recycling of plastic packaging costs more than it yields, companies will benefit from a more cost-effective system of packaging.\n\nc. Regulated Storage, Manufacture and Use of plastics. India required its states to enforce existing rules on the storage, manufacture, and use of some single-use plastics in lieu of a nationwide ban. Meanwhile, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is yet to issue a list of non-environmentally accepted products (NEAP) as provided in Republic Act 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act, passed a decade ago.
