The type indicates the\ntraining stage of the model and is chosen from {Pretrained, Instruction-tuned, Alignment-tuned}. Models based on\nSOLAR 10.7B are colored purple. The best scores for H6 and the individual tasks are shown in bold.\nMetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2023) dataset.\nWe reformatted the instruction datasets with an\nAlpaca-styled chat template. For datasets such as\nOpenOrca, which are derived from FLAN (Long-\npre et al., 2023), we filter data that overlaps with\nthe benchmark datasets (see Tab. 8 in Appendix. C\nfor more information). The alignment datasets\nare in the {prompt, chosen, rejected} triplet for-\nmat. We preprocess the alignment datasets follow-\ning Zephyr (Tunstall et al., 2023). We use Data-\nverse (Park et al., 2024) for data preprocessing.\nEvaluation. In the HuggingFace Open LLM\nLeaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023), six types of\nevaluation methods are presented: ARC (Clark\net al., 2018), HellaSWAG (Zellers et al., 2019),\nMMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), TruthfulQA (Lin\net al., 2022), Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021),\nand GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). We utilize these\ndatasets as benchmarks for evaluation and also re-\nport the average scores for the six tasks, e.g., H6.\nWe either submit directly to the Open LLM Leader-\nboard or utilize Evalverse (Kim et al., 2024b) for\nrunning evaluations locally.\nModel merging. Model merging methods such\nas Yadav et al. (2023) can boost model perfor-\nmance without further training. We merge some\nof the models that we trained in both the instruc-\ntion and alignment tuning stages. We implement\nour own merging methods although popular open\nsource also exist such as MergeKit .\n4.2 Main Results\nWe present evaluation results for our SOLAR\n10.7B and SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct models along\n3https: / / github . com/ cg123 /mergekit\nwith other top-performing models in Tab. 2. SO-\nLAR 10.7B outperforms other pretrained models\nof similar sizes, such as Qwen 14B and Mistral\n7B, which shows that DUS is an effective method\nto up-scale base LLMs. Furthermore, despite the\nsmaller size, SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct scores the\nhighest in terms of H6, even surpassing the recent\ntop-performing open-source LLM Mixtral 8x7B-\nInstruct-v0.1 or Qwen 72B. The above results indi-\ncate DUS can up-scale models that are capable of\nachieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-\ntuned. We also report data contamination results\nfor SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct in Appendix C.\n4.3 Ablation Studies\nWe present ablation studies for both the instruction\nand alignment tuning stages. Note that the evalua-\ntion results for the following studies are ran locally\nand may vary from results obtained by submitting\nto the Open LLM Leaderboard.\n4.3.1 Instruction Tuning\nAblation on the training datasets. We present\nablation studies using different training datasets\nfor the instruction tuning in Tab. 3. The ablated\nmodels are prefixed with SFT for supervised fine-\ntuning. 'SFT v1' only uses the Alpaca-GPT4\ndataset, whereas 'SFT v2' also uses the OpenOrca\ndataset. 'SFT v3' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct\ndataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v2'.\nSimilarly, 'SFT v4' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct\ndataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v1'.\nFirst, we analyze how Alpaca-GPT4 and\nOpenOrca affect the trained models. The first ab-\nlated model, 'SFT v1' , which used only the Alpaca-\nGPT4 dataset for training, resulted in 69.15 for H6."

Moreover, efforts are under-\nway to replace even such prompt engineering with\nLLMs (Yang et al., 2023).\nB.4 Instruction Tuning\nTo enhance the steerability of LLMs, instruction\ntuning (Wei et al., 2021) has emerged as a learning\ntechnique. This involves fine-tuning LLMs using\ndata formatted as (instruction, input, output) for\nvarious tasks ( Wang et al., 2022). Instruction tuning\nallows for targeted adjustments, providing a more\ncontrolled and task-oriented improvement to the\nmodel's capabilities.\nBefore instruction tuning, existing methods\nfaced challenges in effectively guiding and control-\nling the behavior of large language models (Zhang\net al., 2023). The sheer complexity of these models\nmade it difficult to ensure precise and task-oriented\nresponses. The need for a more targeted approach\narose from the limitations of existing methods, lead-\ning to the development of instruction tuning. This\ntargeted approach enables better control over the\nmodel's behavior, making it more suitable for spe-\ncific tasks and improving its overall performance in\nalignment with user-defined objectives. Therefore,\ninstruction tuning is computationally efficient and\nfacilitates the rapid adaptation of LLMs to a spe-\ncific domain without requiring extensive retraining\nor architectural changes.\nB.5 Alignment Tuning\nLLM has been observed to generate sentences that\nmay be perceived as linguistically incongruent by\nhuman readers since they learned not human inten-\ntion, but only vast knowledge across various do-\nmains in the pretraining step (Ziegler et al., 2019).\nTo overcome this limitation and align with human\nintentions, previous research (Ziegler et al., 2019)\nhave proposed Reinforcement Learning with Hu-\nman Feedback (RLHF). RLHF operates by learning\na reward model based on human preferences, em-\nploying reinforcement learning to guide the LLM\ntowards prioritizing answers with the highest re-\nward scores. This process enhances the safety,\npropriety, and overall quality of the generated re-\nsponses. Despite demonstrating satisfactory per-\nformance, RLHF encounters challenges such as\nmanaging numerous hyperparameters and necessi-\ntating the incorporation of multiple models (policy,\nvalue, reward, and reference models).\nIn response to these challenges, the supervised\nfine-tuning based approaches have proposed, such\nas Rank Responses to align Human Feedback\n(RRHF) (Yuan et al., 2023), Reward rAnked Fine-\nTuning (RAFT) (Dong et al., 2023), and Direct\nPolicy Optimization (DPO) (Intel, 2023). They\navoid the complexities associated with reinforce-\nment learning while achieving empirical perfor-\nmance comparable to RLHF. Among them, DPO\nthat we used directly guides the LLM to increase\nthe probability of positive responses and decrease\nthe probability of negative responses through a \"di-\nrect\" approach. Interestingly, DPO demonstrates\nmore stable learning results compared to RLHF,\ndespite its simple training approach.\nB.6 Data Contamination\nRecent researches (Zhou et al., 2023; Sainz et al.,\n2023; Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023; Deng et al.,\n2023) emphasize the need to measure whether a\nspecific benchmark was used to train the large lan-\nguage models. There are three types of the data\ncontamination: guideline, raw text and annota-\ntion (Sainz et al., 2023). Guideline contamination\noccurs when a model accesses detailed annotation\nguidelines for a dataset, providing advantages in\nspecific tasks, and its impact should be considered,\nespecially in zero and few-shot evaluations. Raw\ntext contamination occurs when a model has ac-\ncess to the original text. Wikipedia is widely used\nas a pretraining data, but also as a source for cre-\nating new datasets. The caution is advised in the\ndevelopment of automatically annotated datasets\nsourced from the web. Annotation contamina-"

The recyclability of plastic packaging can often be improved by:\n\n- · choosing a common type of plastic (such as PE, PP or PET);\n- · choosing a common color (white or transparent); and\n- · avoiding combinations of materials, such as plastic windows in cardboard\n- packaging.

                    "text": "The 2xSJ task provides estimates that correlate fairly well with equivalent\nparameters estimated using TOJs, SJs, and ternary tasks. However, each trial\ntakes longer than in those single-presentation tasks, which makes experi-\nments more onerous. There are a few reasons why the roving-standard 2xSJ is\nstill worth considering. Firstly, it asks about synchrony explicitly (unlike the\nTOJ) and by requiring relative judgements it reveals a point of maximal syn-\nchrony perception (whereas the SJ and ternary tasks often reveal a range of\nSOA values that are classified as synchronous). Secondly, it can be added in\nto a single-presentation task (as a follow-up question every two trials), which\nsomewhat mitigates the burden of additional experimental time.

Studying and practicing behavioral economics should occur<br>simultaneously, which, in turn, suggests a course taught more according to a practicum approach than<br>in a traditionally styled lecture format.

Then, the 'layer distance' ,\nor the difference in the layer indices in the base\nmodel, is only bigger than 1 where layers n and\nn + 1 are connected, i.e., at the seam.\nHowever, this results in maximum layer distance\nat the seam, which may be too significant of a\ndiscrepancy for continued pretraining to quickly\nresolve. Instead, depthwise scaling sacrifices the\n2m middle layers, thereby reducing the discrep-\nancy at the seam and making it easier for continued\n2https : / /huggingface . co/ Undi 95 /\nMistral-11B-v0 · 1"

These experiments helped motivate the revised theories of human choice behavior, such as\nKahneman and Tversky's (1979) Prospect Theory, which form another pillar of behavioral economics.\nAlongside these experiments, Section 2 presents the revised theories of human choice behavior with\nvarying degrees of rigor. This is where the theoretical bases of Homo economicus' rational choice\nbehavior are examined, and where key refinements to this theory are developed-theoretical\nrefinements underpinning the myriad departures from rational choice behavior we witness Homo\nsapiens make in this section's laboratory and field experiments (and which are examined further in\nSections 3 and 4).\nSection 3 submerses the student in the world of behavioral game theory. Here we explore games\nsuch as Ultimatum Bargaining presented in Example 5. We follow Camerer (2003)'s lead, first by\ncharacterizing the games analytically (i.e., identifying solution, or equilibrium, concepts that are\npredicted to result when members of Homo economicus play the games), and then by discussing\nempirical results obtained from corresponding field experiments conducted with Homo sapiens. It\nis within the context of these games and field experiments that theories of social interaction are\ntested concerning inter alia trust and trustworthiness, honesty, fairness, reciprocity, etc. As with the\nthought and laboratory experiments presented in Sections 1 and 2, the games and field experiments\npresented in Section 3 are meant to be replicated with students as subjects and the instructor as the\nexperimenter, or researcher.\nFinally, Section 4 wades into the vast sea of empirical research and choice architecture. Here the\nstudent explores studies reporting on (1) the outcomes of actual policy nudges, such as the SMarT\nretirement-savings plan presented in Example 3 of the Introduction, (2) analyses of secondary datasets\nto test for choice behavior consistent with the revised theories discussed in Section 2, such as the test\nfor loss aversion in Example 4 of the Introduction, and (3) analyses of primary datasets obtained from\nnovel field experiments to further test the revised theories. The main purpose of this section is not\nonly to introduce the student to interesting empirical studies and policy adaptations in the field of\nbehavioral economics, but also, in the process, to incubate in the student an abiding appreciation for\n3\nthe obscure settings that sometimes lend themselves to such study.\nTHE TEXTBOOK'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RIGOR\nBecause the mathematical and computational rigor of material presented in this textbook varies\nthroughout, particularly in Sections 2 - 4, the extent of the rigor used in the presentation of a\ngiven topic is indicated with superscripts. Topics without a superscript are considered basic and\nuniversal enough that backgrounds in economics, mathematics, or statistics are not required for the\nreader to understand the material. Topics with a single asterisk (*) indicate that higher mathematical\nreasoning skills are recommended for the reader to fully grasp the material. Topics with a double\n3. Our approach to studying behavioral economics is focused on the underlying laboratory experimentation and behavioral\ngames that form the bedrock of the field. As such, we eschew delving into related fields such as neuroeconomics and\nauction theory. See Cartwright (2018) and Just (2013) for introductions to the former and latter fields, respectively.\nXX ARTHUR J. CAPLAN"

The<br>return of migrant workers to their home countries contributed to significant<br>labour shortages (Lee and David, 2021; Sriring and Staporncharnchai, 2021).4<br>COVID-related movement restrictions caused many workers to withdraw<br>from the labour force (especially women) and labour force participation rates<br>declined in most countries.5 This was the case for Indonesia, Malaysia, the<br>Philippines, and Viet Nam (Figure 1.4). According to the ILO (2021c), female<br>employment in AMS in 2020 was 3.9 percent lower than the expected level,<br>which is markedly less than the 2.7 percent figure for male employment. 6<br>The impact of the pandemic on employment is evident in lower labour force<br>participation, lower working hours, and higher unemployment rates in most<br>countries (Figure 1.5).</p>\n\n<br><figure data-category='chart'><img id='3' style='font-size:14px' alt=\"18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nBrunei Cambodia Indonesia Lao PDR Malaysia Myanmar Philippines Singapore Thailand Viet Nam\nDarussalam\n2020 2021\" data-coord=\"top-left:(224,774); bottom-right:(1102,1227)\" /><figcaption id='2' style='font-size:20px'>Figure 1.3.

This is because they are overrepresented in sectors hardest hit by the pandemic: accommodation<br>and food services; retail and wholesale trade; and other services, such as arts, recreation, and public<br>administration.<br>6 This is equivalent to saying there is greater increase in unemployment or inactivity for women compared<br>to men.

            "text": "2\nNumerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations\nalso plays an important role in error analysis (investigating the difference between the numerical\napproximation and the solution).\nCalculating with only a finite subset of the rational numbers has many consequences. For exam-\nple: a computer cannot distinguish between two polynomials of sufficiently high degree. Conse-\nquently, methods based on the main theorem of algebra (i.e. that an nth degree polynomial has\nexactly n complex zeros) cannot be trusted. Errors that follow from the use of finitely many digits\nare called rounding errors (Section 1.4).\nAn important aspect of numerical mathematics is the emphasis on efficiency. Contrary to or-\ndinary mathematics, numerical mathematics considers an increase in efficiency, i.e. a decrease\nof the number of operations and / or amount of storage required, as an essential improvement.\nProgress in this aspect is of great practical importance and the end of this development has not\nbeen reached yet. Here, the creative mind will meet many challenges. On top of that, revolutions\nin computer architecture will overturn much conventional wisdom.\n1.3 Why numerical mathematics?\nA big advantage of numerical mathematics is that it can provide answers to problems that do not\nadmit closed-form solutions. Consider for example the integral\n元\n/ V1 + cos2 xdx.\n0\nThis is an expression for the arc length of one arc of the curve y(x) = sin x, which does not have\na solution in closed form. A numerical method, however, can approximate this integral in a very\nsimple way (Chapter 5). An additional advantage is that a numerical method only uses stan-\ndard function evaluations and the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\nBecause these are exactly the operations a computer can perform, numerical mathematics and\ncomputers form a perfect combination.\nAn advantage of analytical methods is that the solution is given by a mathematical formula.\nFrom this, insight in the behavior and the properties of the solution can be gained. For numerical\napproximations, however, this is not the case. In that case, visualization tools may be used to gain\ninsight in the behavior of the solution. Using a numerical method to draw a graph of a function\nis usually a more useful tool than evaluating the solution at a large number of points.\n1.4 Rounding errors\nA computer uses a finite representation of the all numbers in R.

Despite his role as a\npoor peasant, Kazrac's theatrical costume is em-\nbellished with embroidery and a gold trim, and the\ncharacter wears white stockings. Additionally,\nGrimaldi sports a braided pigtail and long mous-\ntache and brandishes two curved swords.

Steinkirche\nwas off the main road near the second railway station south of Strehlen,\nprobably on a hill, something my mother had never mentioned. If one\npassed it, one could also locate it as station number two of the seven\nbetween Strehlen and Milnsterberg, on the railway running south of\nBreslau towards the Carpathian Mountains. Then I noted the Polish\nnames for the two townships south of Wroclaw (Breslau). In the German-\nto-Polish Gazeteer they are given as Strzelin and Ziebice.\nMy intention was to take a train or a car to the new Polish ex-Steinkirche,\nvisit it discreetly, and search the old cemetery for family connections.\nI wanted to photograph my two-year-old granddaughter beside my own\ngrandfather Friedrich's grave. I wanted to look for other evidence of family\nhistory, and just savour the atmosphere of the place. I also wanted to see\nwhat had happened to Neumarkt Platz.\nIt was difficult to achieve anything in a hurry. In London, my daughter,\ngranddaughter and I visited the office of the Polish Consulate. Tourist\nbrochures were generously given to us, but none of the authoritative road\nmaps of Poland showed the villages between Strzelin and Ziebice. Did our\nvillage still exist? And by what name?\nAfter flying to Berlin, we set out in a hire car for Wroclaw on 13 September\n2003. Beside the Hitler-era Autobahn, there are still extensive forests,\nbetween flat farmlands. It was raining when we entered Poland.\n9"

De-<br>viance (sometimes called G2) is a measure based on log likelihood, but which<br>looks rather more like summed squared error, in that it is zero for a perfectly<br>fitting model and large/positive for a poorly fitting model. Formally, deviance<br>is two times the difference in log likelihood between the saturated model and<br>the model with our current set of parameters.

Because these fish are obligate breathers, they are traditionally harvested by fishers<br>using harpoons at the time when they surface to breathe. Men typically fish from canoes and search for<br>signs of Arapaima near the surface. As they near the Arapaima, the harpooner throws the harpoon by hand.<br>This is a specialized type of fishing, and the local fishers possess knowledge of the behavior that increases<br>their likelihood of catching one.

Much of the catch is illegal, with most specimens<br>being caught below the minimum size limit or during the closed season (Cavole et al. 2015). The small-scale<br>fishers are geographically dispersed, and governments in these regions have insufficient resources to devote<br>to enforcing fishing rules. The riverine fishers who target Arapaima are marginalized and have limited formal<br>education. Yet, compliance with regulations is essential to prevent overfishing and local extinction.</p>\n<p id='5' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>Arapaima represent only a small fraction of the fisheries harvest, but they are culturally important and symbolic<br>as a flagship genus of tropical South American fisheries and floodplain management and conservation.

Any threat to<br>one of the habitats or the corridor that connects them can influence these important food fish (Goulding et al.<br>2019).</p>\n<footer id='6' style='font-size:14px'>Integrating Fishers in the Management of Arapaima I 251</footer>",

Because these fish are obligate breathers, they are traditionally harvested by fishers\nusing harpoons at the time when they surface to breathe. Men typically fish from canoes and search for\nsigns of Arapaima near the surface. As they near the Arapaima, the harpooner throws the harpoon by hand.\nThis is a specialized type of fishing, and the local fishers possess knowledge of the behavior that increases\ntheir likelihood of catching one. With appropriate training, fishers' participation in management processes can\ncontribute to the conservation and governance of these small-scale fisheries.\n\nMany populations of Arapaima have been driven to local extinction due to overfishing (Castello et al. 2015a;\nGurdak 2019a; Watson et al. 2021; Freitas and Sousa 2021). Much of the catch is illegal, with most specimens\nbeing caught below the minimum size limit or during the closed season (Cavole et al. 2015). The small-scale\nfishers are geographically dispersed, and governments in these regions have insufficient resources to devote\nto enforcing fishing rules.

It has implications for how we would\nlook for it. For number 5, there is more than one\nbook with the title Encyclopedia of Propaganda, and\nalso it's unlikely they meant to refer to the whole\nencyclopedia.\n· The difference between discovering a source on a\nsocial media platform and citing the content. Is\nenough information given to find the Pinterest\nsource? Revisit the creator concept from the chapter,\nTypes of Sources. Social media companies distribute\nbut do not create content, SO they are not the ones\nthat should be cited. Opportunity to talk about\nspecific sources students have found on social media"

Rather\nthan looking at the things of the Nights as colorful\ndetails in Sheherazade's tales or protagonists in the\nfantasticstories they make forthemselves, we could\nexplore, instead, their role as as bearers of cultural\nknowledge unintentionally embedded in the fabric\nof the text. In such a reading, \"historically and theo-\nretically overdetermined material charactersitics\nof objects are sought out beyond the immediate\ncontext in which they appear\"86 in order to\n86 Elaine Freedgood, \"Introduction: Reading Things,\" in\nThe Idea in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian\nNovel (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006),\n5-6.\ndefetishize them and expose the power structures\nin which they are involved.\nThus, as Makdisi and Nussbaum sum up in their\nintroduction to The Arabian Nights in Historical\nContext: Between East and West, \"the Nights offered\na particularly powerful vision of an Asiatic culture\nseemingly saturated with references to sensuality,\nextravagance, indulgence, violence, supernatural-\nism, and eroticism ... [and] added a supernatural\ndimension to the Enlightenment; the tales offered\nan avenue into modernity through its magical op-\nposite, an alternative to European identity, and an\nantidote to neoclassicism.\"87 However, reading\nsuch imports as an expression of European pow-\ners' disavowal of the East in order to \"justify their\nconquest and rule over other peoples, particularly\nin Asia,\"88 is an oversimplification of a rather com-\nplicated process of cultural exchange. None of\nthese descriptions of Arabia were caused by colo-\nnial \"distortions,\" as Said feared, but by false attri-\nbutions: \"Arabian\" was a misnomer that rarely de-\nscribed Arabia itself. While fictional narratives like\nArabian Nights' Entertainments represented Ara-\nbia as a land of magic and exorbitant riches, they\nwere too far-fetched to be part of a Westerner's\nbelief system during the Age of Reason; rather,\nthey were popularized because their wild fiction-\nality turned them into bestsellers at the time. Such\nstories competed with descriptions of the Arabi-\nan Peninsula by travelers and traders who had vis-\nited the area and had unmediated contact with the\nlocal culture. However, while the Orientalist litera-\nture described Arabia in terms that emphasized\nits exoticism, magic, superstitions, extravagance,\nwealth, eroticism, excess, and myriads of other pe-\nculiarities that contrasted it with the European\nnormativity, travel narratives created an \"Arabian\"\nidentity that was generally congruent with the\nreality of the place.\n87 Makdisi and Nussbaum, introduction to The Arabian\nNights in Historical Context, 5·\n88 Ibid."

None of\nthese descriptions of Arabia were caused by colo-\nnial \"distortions,\" as Said feared, but by false attri-\nbutions: \"Arabian\" was a misnomer that rarely de-\nscribed Arabia itself. While fictional narratives like\nArabian Nights' Entertainments represented Ara-\nbia as a land of magic and exorbitant riches, they\nwere too far-fetched to be part of a Westerner's\nbelief system during the Age of Reason; rather,\nthey were popularized because their wild fiction-\nality turned them into bestsellers at the time. Such\nstories competed with descriptions of the Arabi-\nan Peninsula by travelers and traders who had vis-\nited the area and had unmediated contact with the\nlocal culture. However, while the Orientalist litera-\nture described Arabia in terms that emphasized\nits exoticism, magic, superstitions, extravagance,\nwealth, eroticism, excess, and myriads of other pe-\nculiarities that contrasted it with the European\nnormativity, travel narratives created an \"Arabian\"\nidentity that was generally congruent with the\nreality of the place."

IRAS was equipped<br>with a 0.6-meter telescope cooled to a temperature of less than 10<br>K. For the first time, the infrared sky could be seen as if it were<br>night, rather than through a bright foreground of atmospheric and<br>telescope emissions. IRAS carried out a rapid but comprehensive<br>survey of the entire infrared sky over a 10-month period, cataloging<br>about 350,000 sources of infrared radiation.

In<br>The Netherlands, speeding tickets are usually processed in a fully automated fashion, and the<br>perpetrator will receive the tickets within a couple of weeks after the offence. The Dutch police<br>optimized the procedures of speed control such that this effort has become very profitable to the<br>Dutch government. Various strategies for speed control are carried out by police forces, which<br>are all based on the position of the vehicle at consecutive times. The actual velocity follows from<br>the first-order derivative of the position of the vehicle with respect to time. Since no explicit<br>formula for this position is available, the velocity can only be estimated using an approximation<br>of the velocity based on several discrete vehicle positions at discrete times. This motivates the use<br>of approximate derivatives, also called numerical derivatives. If the police want to know whether<br>the offender drove faster before speed detection (in other words, whether the perpetrator hit the<br>brakes after having seen the police patrol), or whether the driver was already accelerating, then<br>they are also interested in the acceleration of the 'bad guy'. This acceleration can be estimated<br>using numerical approximations of the second-order derivative of the car position with respect<br>to time.</p>\n<p id='4' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>Since the time-interval of recording is nonzero, the velocity is not determined exactly in general.<br>In this chapter, the resulting error, referred to as the truncation error, is estimated using Taylor se-<br>ries. In most cases, the truncation error increases with an increasing size of the recording interval<br>(Sections 3.2 and 3.4). Next to the truncation error, the measurement of the position of the vehicle<br>is also prone to measurement errors. Issues that influence the results are, for example, paral-<br>lax, the measurement equipment, and in some cases even the performance of the police officer<br>(in car-videoing and laser control). These measurement errors provide an additional deteriora-<br>tion of the approximation of the speed and acceleration.

This\nis because palm oil is the main raw material for biodiesel in Indonesia.\n\nCPO is the primary product derived from the red fruit of the oil palm, while palm kernel\noil, derived from the fruit's nut, is considered a secondary product. Oil palm biomass\nincludes EFBs, palm mesocarps fibres (PMFs), PKS, oil palm fronds, oil palm trunks, as well\nas palm oil mill effluent (POME). Oil palm fronds account for 70% of the total oil palm\nbiomass produced, while EFB accounts for 10% and oil palm trunks account for only about\n5% of the total biomass produced.\n\nAccording to Harahap et al. (2019), Indonesia housed 11 million hectares (Mha) of oil palm\nplantations and produced 31 million tonnes (Mt) of CPO in 2015. Oil extraction from palm\nfruits occurs in palm oil mills.

The\nalliance also prioritized domestic over foreign vessels and set limits on the number of purse-seine vessels. The\nissue of sovereignty over tuna that migrate freely among EEZs remains a concern for small island nations (Bailey\net al. 2012). Working to establish fair and equitable allocations of total allowable catches to the many parties will\nrequire more equitable sharing with the larger tuna-fishing nations.",
                    "text": "The Pacific Ocean has consistently had the highest landings, about 66% of the world's tuna catch. The western\nand central Pacific Ocean is where many artisanal and industrial fisheries overlap. For the small island nations,\nfishing provides a major source of income, jobs, and food security (Bell et al. 2019). Yet, Pacific island nations\nhave not fully realized the economic potential with the global tuna industry, despite the fact that 80% of it is\ncaught within their exclusive economic zones (EEZs, i.e., within 200 miles).

This is a form of what would, in classical signal detection theory,<br>be described as a two-alternative forced choice (specifically the two-interval<br>forced choice variant).

Not\nwhat you would expect for a grassroots effort lead by\nwaitstaff."
